# üê≥ Docker + PHP 8.2 + MySQL + Nginx + Symfony 6.2 Boilerplate

## Description

This is a complete stack for running Symfony 6.4 into Docker containers using docker-compose tool.

It is composed by 3 containers:

- `nginx`, acting as the webserver.
- `php`, the PHP-FPM container with the 8.2 version of PHP.
- `db` which is the MySQL database container with a **MySQL 8.0** image.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.

2. If you are working with Docker Desktop for Mac, ensure **you have enabled `VirtioFS` for your sharing implementation**. `VirtioFS` brings improved I/O performance for operations on bind mounts. Enabling VirtioFS will automatically enable Virtualization framework.

3. Create the file `./.docker/.env.nginx.local` using `./.docker/.env.nginx` as template. The value of the variable `NGINX_BACKEND_DOMAIN` is the `server_name` used in NGINX.

4. Go inside folder `./docker` and run `docker compose up -d` to start containers.

5. Inside the `php` container, run `composer install` to install dependencies from `/var/www/symfony` folder.

6. Use the following value for the DATABASE_URL environment variable:
```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://app_user:helloworld@db:3306/app_db?serverVersion=8.0.33
```
7. Run the migrations in `php` container `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`

8. Run the data fixtures in `php` container `php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load`

9. cd `./ui` and run `npm i` then `npm start`

You could change the name, user and password of the database in the `env` file at the root of the project.
